# RealEstate (project01)
RealEstate is the secong project in software engineering immersive course in General Assembly. It is a CRUD application made using Ruby on Rails and postgreSQL and utilises users, agents, and properries in the database to handle functionality. The design of the website was done using bootstrap.

# Usage
Browsing the website requires user account creation or login. Username, email, and password are validated upon account creation and the password is digested by bcrypt and stored as a digested password in the database. A user that has a realestate can register a new realestate. Admin has the ability to see the list og users and agents and delete them.

## Challenges
- Adding the serach functinality was a challenge. 

# To be implemented
In future, the following features will be implemented to RealEstate

- Making two types of users, normal users can only explore the property for rent or sale. Other users are realestate that can post or delete properties on the website.
- Watchlist will be added to let users save the properties that are interested in.
- A google API will be added to show the location of the property on the map.
- A new feature will be added to post a property for both rent and sell.

# Bugs/Issues
- Responsiveness - lacking responsive UI.
